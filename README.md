# The Effectiveness of Social Media Infographics
Given the prevalence of complicated world events as well as the ongoing popularity of social media, I decided to look into the effectiveness of social media infographics commonly seen on Instagram and other social media platforms.

To do so, I surveyed just under 100 people, the results of which can be found, cleaned and uncleaned, as csv files.

I then summarized the demographics of the respondents and the key findings on Tableau.
My Tableau dashboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/MidBootcampProject_16993791601290/Responses?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link


Lastly, I presented my findings in a presentation, which can be found here as a pdf.
